### -- the b(ART) project  --

From barista to BARTista, I've recently picked up busking at BART stations in SF. Busking, for those who are not familiar, is the art of performing in public areas - and frankly, it's been quite a cathartic experience for me. I've played semi-professionally in organized groups throughout my life but these impromptu performances have provided a creative outlet while allowing bypassers listen in to their choosing (and at their own risk, I suppose). 

In this case, my dear friend and professional busker, John Bridenbeck is my duo partner. Check out our first recorded project ever at Powell station.
