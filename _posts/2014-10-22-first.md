With the Scandinavia trip right around the corner (starting tomorrow), I'm super ecstatic to finally start the prep! 
I do have my wardrobe ready as well as a handful of arrangements made with couchsurfing hosts. It's finally sinking in that I'm going to different European design capitals. The plan is, Stockholm > Gothenburg > Copenhagen > back to Stockholm. Gothenburg is purely out of my interest and reverance for few of my favorite musicians' origins, e.g. Little Dragon and Jose Gonzales.
