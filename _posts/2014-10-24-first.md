With the Scandinavia trip right around the corner (starting tomorrow), I'm super ecstatic to finally start the prep! 
I do have my wardrobe ready as well as a handful of arrangements made with couchsurfing hosts. I'm not sure my bank will ever be ready though, considering that the cheapest beer starts at $17 USD. Sadly, that is my point of reference.

It's finally sinking in that I'm going to different European design capitals. I want to be inspired! I want to absorb my surroundings. The plan is, Stockholm > Gothenburg > Copenhagen > back to Stockholm. Gothenburg is purely out of my interest and reverance for few of my favorite musicians' origins, e.g. Little Dragon and Jose Gonzales.

I feel fortunate that my best girlfriend-in-crime, Annie is joining me. She's lived in Stockholm for 6 months for study abroad in the past, so I could definitely utilize her country expertise.. and we're bound to create some double trouble. 

Super stoked! Alright.. on to real planning. Stay tuned.
