title: a taste of sweden + denmark

The 9-day trip to Stockholm and Copenhagen is now over and I have to say, I'm quite content to be back in lovely San Francisco. The weather wasn't as travel-friendly as we expected (as it rained half the time), and I was reminded by locals that it was low season for a reason. Nevertheless, the experience was enhanced by meeting locals through couchsurfing, scoping for and taking advantage of budget options, and embracing the nightlife almost every night.

My friend, Annie and I have observed many peculiarities about Scandinavian culture that I wanted to share here. 

1. The street style is pretty homogenous: stylish young ladies wear over-sized, structured black coats with black leggings, and either black & white Nike sneakers or white chucks. Men wear practical jackets with accented scarves and leather shoes. I actually expected more color and unconventional looks because we were visiting the design capitals of Europe, but was left a bit disappointed.

2. Cost of living ridiculous. Yes, we were visiting welfare states where citizens pay 40% of their salary income to the government, so the prices reflect the pricey economy. But for the rest of us, $9 lattes, $11 fast-food burgers, $25 cocktails prove to be extroardinarily steep. The Copenhagen airport had the fanciest stores, including the likes of Marc by Marc Jacobs, Prada, and Gucci.

3. And yet, the Danes and Swedes have an obsession with cheap hot dogs sold on the street. Cheap, meaning starting price $5 of course. 

4. Hot drinks are served in glass cups, not mugs.

5. Scandinavians are incredibly shy with foreigners. When I've traveled to other countries where there are a shortage of Asians present, I would usually get many questions regarding my 'origins' or 'heritage'. However, I never got a single question of "where I'm really from", despite having encountered locals by asking for directions, suggestions, etc. In social settings, it was hard to break the shell in conversations as well.

6. We visited a small part of Copenhagen called Christiania, partly an anarchic state formed in the 70's where it is governed by its own special laws. It is a commune also referred to as 'Freetown' or 'Fristaden', where weed is freely sold and traded on its streets pretty much unregulated. It was fascinating to witness the way in which people lived - we were surrounded by Bob Marley-esque murals, booths for free clothes, corners to purchase weed, children roaming about with no adult supervision.

It was wild to experience these 'oddities', or more like differences in culture. Here are some highlights of the trip:
